# Hi there!

>[!TIP] HEY THERE!
>This note probably caught your attention. Rightfully so!

Despite what I have stated in the [[index|landing page]] of this Public Journal, I think this place is where I would generally recommend people to start, when they fiddle with my website.

This is going to be some sort of a **User's Guide to the Author**. Sure, you might see my quirks from my #articles and my [[_index-dailies|Dailies entries]] here and there, but the cream of the crop's gonna be here, right here, in this page, when you want to know who I am.

Think of this page as an introductory page, or perhaps the usual **about** page of websites, except with one catch: It's not going to be about the website, per se, as in the Public Journal (enough information about that can be found in, again, the [[index|landing page]]). 

Instead, this page is about the author himself, which is me.

# Okay, so who are you?
