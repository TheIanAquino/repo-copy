## Highlights
- I started learning how to code only 10 months ago.
  I am NOT a very talented coder. But with the help of:
  - AI tools
  - Automation platforms
  - No-code tools
  ...I can build nearly anything I want.
  Here are the exact tools I used to learn how to code (all are free): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315536404787200))
- TL;DR version:
  (For context, I chose to learn JavaScript.)
  - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures by @freeCodeCamp (start here)
  - The Modern JavaScript Tutorial by @iliakan 
  - That Weird JavaScript Course by @fireship_dev 
  - The MDN Web Docs by @MozDevNet
  - ChatGPT ðŸ˜‰ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315538921365507))
- Best place to start:
  JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures by @freeCodeCamp 
  I started with this course. It goes from the absolute basics all the way to very advanced problems.
  Best of all, each lesson is interactive and makes you write code.

- Best general tutorial:
  The Modern Javascript Tutorial by @iliakan and team
  This site does an amazing job of actually explaining all the ins and outs of JavaScript.

- Most entertaining resource:
  That Weird JavaScript Course by @fireship_dev
  A series of YouTube videos that are a great way to prime your learning.
  Fireship is also just an amazing channel for learning to code in any language.

- Best reference:
  The MDN Web Docs by @MozDevNet
  Hands-down the best reference for JS. Every method, operator, and detail of the language is detailed here with lots of examples.
  Bookmark this one; you'll be here often.

- Best helper:
  ChatGPT by @OpenAI
  ChatGPT can be an amazing tutor, assistant, and debugger.
  I almost always have it open in another tab while coding.
  It's not always perfect, but for the basics it's very, very good.

- Beyond using these resources, the best way to learn how to code is to write a lot of code.
  Focus on projects you're interested in.
  When you're solving problems you care about, you'll be motivated to learn more deeply and retain more as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315598920876038))
- This also means choosing a language based on what you want to build!
  I chose JavaScript because I want to build things on the web.
  But if you want to make games, there may be better picks.
  This @fireship_dev video can help you choose a language:

- Two bonuses:
  First, I built my @NotionHQ API tutorial to act as an entire beginner programming course that includes a fun project (building a PokÃ©dex).

- Beyond the syntax, programming is really just building machines.
  So the real skills are:
  - Learning how to break problems into pieces
  - Understanding inputs
  - Knowing how to modify inputs at each step
  - Understanding capacities and constraints
  - Anticipating and handling errors ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315615710625792))
- So while you need to actually write and read code to learn syntax, you can learn a lot of the fundamental concepts by working with no-code tools and even playing certain types of games. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315617690288129))
- To wrap up, here are some of the tools and platforms that allow my basic coding skills to do really advanced things:
  - @pipedream connects APIs
  - @devutils_app has a ton of useful helper tools
  - @glitch and @Replit are entire dev environments in the cloud ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315619665903619))
- I'll write a more detailed thread in the future about all the no-code and helper tools I use.
  You can also follow me @TomFrankly so you don't miss it. If you found this one useful, consider sharing the first tweet.
  Happy to answer any questions as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1655315622081748992))
