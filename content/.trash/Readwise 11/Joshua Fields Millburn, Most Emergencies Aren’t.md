    - Note: Something about this reminds me that we *can* control our tools (gadgets such as phones, tablets, etc). But we often forget that we could because they're too sophisticated. They function on systems smarter than us, and so we often don't realize that we're the ones being controlled, instead of the other way around. How do we solve this? By having values. By knowing the direction we should go toward, we would know how to use our tools.
