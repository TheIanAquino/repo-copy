## Highlights
- The effects of socio-economic status on student achievement are well-known, and specific economic and cultural mechanisms linking studentsâ€™ socio-economic status and achievement have been studied extensively (Bourdieu, 1986[10]; Coleman, 1988[11]; Paino and Renzulli, 2012[12]; Kao and Thompson, 2003[13]; Eriksson et al., 2021[14]).

- Students whose parents have higher levels of education, and more prestigious and better-paid jobs benefit from a wider range of financial (e.g. private tutoring, computers, books), cultural (e.g. extended vocabulary, time management skills) and social (e.g. role models and networks) resources. This makes it easier for them to succeed in school compared with students from families with lower levels of education or that are affected by chronic unemployment, low-paid jobs or poverty. Economic deprivation and adversity during early childhood undermine cognitive development (Richards and Wadsworth, 2004[15]; Duncan, Brooks-Gunn and Klebanov, 1994[16]).
