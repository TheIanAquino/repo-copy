Your ideas are the most valuable currency in a knowledge-driven economy. Just as an investment account allows your money to grow day and night without your involvement, content does the same with your ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0kbf72t37ke6phej3g3pmze))
- Content builds on itself. It multiplies and compounds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jh8mmsc7qwqkqgn8kfk4mk))

- Until recently, the average person wasn’t able to publish and distribute their ideas at a reasonable cost. But on the Internet, anybody, in any corner of the world, in any time zone, can access your best thinking. 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. 365 days a year. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0kbhkpp869w12tfrvwayd9d))

- Make it easy for people to find you. Buy a domain name and use it to create your own website, even if it’s very simple at first. Your website is your resume, your business card, your store, your directory, and your personal magazine. It’s the one place online that you completely own and control – your Online Home.

- When you first begin writing, before you publish anything, your website should have two things:
  1. A Start Here page
  2. A curated list of your favorite articles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0kbprhvq3gsd0zk7xb1wvhx))
- Your Start Here page should answer routine visitor questions. Most readers want guidance, so give it to them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0kbssyqeq50hb44ewedxspz))
- Remember, nobody is familiar with your work like you are. You’ve pored through every sentence on your site, but your readers have only skimmed them at most. In that way, you’re like a host at a party. You’ve planned the party, and it’s your job to make sure people aren’t confused when they arrive at your home. Once they’ve committed to staying, lead them around the place, and introduce them to things that will interest them. If you can do that, you’ve done your job.

It’s the part of the process that most writers want to escape as fast as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0kc4495hbwzwepgzdt1ete2))
