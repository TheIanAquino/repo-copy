## Metadata
- **Author:** Dave Winer
- **Full Title:** Tools for Thought as Cultural Practices, not Computational Objects
- **URL:** https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought
- **Document Note:** The document discusses the history and current state of "tools for thought" and the recent rise of note-taking software. While it does not provide a specific answer on how to introduce design thinking to tools for thought, it suggests that the field should cover a wider scope than just developing note-taking software for white-collar knowledge workers. Therefore, one possible approach could be to expand the focus of tools for thought to include a broader range of activities and user groups, and involve users in the design process using user-centered design principles.
  The document provides information about the history and development of different tools for thought, including both computational and non-computational tools. While the document mentions the rise of new "note-taking" applications in mid-2020 that allow users to collect and connect information, it does not provide a clear answer to how design thinking can help in formulating better tools for thought or whether it is possible to implement tools for thought in the field of design.
  The article discusses the concept of "tools for thought" and how it has evolved over time. While computers are often seen as the most potent thinking tools, the author argues that they should be viewed as a subset of the larger field of tools for thought. The author also notes the rise of new "note-taking" apps and the cultural techniques they teach, which are focused on a narrow band of human activity, specifically white-collar knowledge work. The article suggests expanding the scope of developing better tools for thought to include areas such as forecasting, critical reasoning, audio and visual tools, game development, and spatial understanding.
