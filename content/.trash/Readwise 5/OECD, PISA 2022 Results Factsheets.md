- Students in the Philippines scored less than the OECD average in mathematics, reading and science. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkraydsqtjwmhgh2453kf2fk))
- A smaller proportion of students in the Philippines, than on average across OECD countries, were top performers (Level 5 or 6) in at least one subject. At the same time a smaller proportion of students than on average across OECD countries achieved a minimum level of proficiency (Level 2 or higher) in all three subjects.

- • In the Philippines, 16% of students attained at least Level 2 proficiency in mathematics, significantly less than on average across OECD countries (OECD average: 69%). At a minimum, these students can interpret and recognize, without direct instructions, how a simple situation can be represented mathematically (e.g. comparing the total distance across two alternative routes, or converting prices into a different currency). Over 85% of students in Singapore, Macao (China), Japan, Hong Kong (China)*, Chinese Taipei and Estonia (in descending order of that share) performed at this level or above.
  • Almost no students in the Philippines were top performers in mathematics, meaning that they attained Level 5 or 6 in the PISA mathematics test (OECD average: 9%). Six Asian countries and economies had the largest shares of students who did so: Singapore (41%), Chinese Taipei (32%), Macao (China) (29%), Hong Kong (China)* (27%), Japan (23%) and Korea (23%). At these levels, students can model complex situations mathematically, and can select, compare and evaluate appropriate problem-solving strategies for dealing with them. Only in 16 out of 81 countries and economies participating in PISA 2022 did more than 10% of students attain Level 5 or 6 proficiency.

- • Some 24% of students in the Philippines attained Level 2 or higher in reading (OECD average: 74%). At a minimum, these students can identify the main idea in a text of moderate length, find information based on explicit, though sometimes complex criteria, and can reflect on the purpose and form of texts when explicitly directed to do so. The share of 15-year-old students who attained minimum levels of proficiency in reading (Level 2 or higher) varied from 89% in Singapore to 8% in Cambodia.
  • In the Philippines, almost no students scored at Level 5 or higher in reading (OECD average: 7%). These students can comprehend lengthy texts, deal with concepts that are abstract or counterintuitive, and establish distinctions between fact and opinion, based on implicit cues pertaining to the content or source of the information.

- • Some 23% of students in the Philippines attained Level 2 or higher in science (OECD average: 76%). At a minimum, these students can recognize the correct explanation for familiar scientific phenomena and can use such knowledge to identify, in simple cases, whether a conclusion is valid based on the data provided.
  • In the Philippines, almost no students were top performers in science, meaning that they were proficient at Level 5 or 6 (OECD average: 7%). These students can creatively and autonomously apply their knowledge of and about science to a wide variety of situations, including unfamiliar ones.

- In the Philippines, 36% of students (the largest share) were in the bottom international quintile of the socio-economic scale, meaning that they were among the most disadvantaged students who took the PISA test in 2022. Their average score in mathematics was 344 score points. In Türkiye and Viet Nam, students of similar socio-economic background tend to score significantly higher. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrb1e7mqjcwybe9rgfx806t))
- Some 12% of disadvantaged students in the Philippines were able to score in the top quarter of mathematics performance. These students can be considered academically resilient because, despite their socio-economic disadvantage, they have attained educational excellence by comparison with students in their own country. On average across OECD countries, 10% of disadvantaged students scored in the top quarter of mathematics performance in their own countries.

- Girls outperformed boys in mathematics by 14 score points and in reading by 35 score points in the Philippines. Globally, in mathematics, boys outperformed girls in 40 countries and economies, girls outperformed boys in another 17 countries or economies, and no significant difference was found in the remaining 24. In reading, girls, on average, scored above boys in all but two countries and economies that participated in PISA 2022 (79 out of 81).

- In the Philippines, the share of low performers is larger among boys (86%) than among girls (82%) in mathematics; in reading, too, the share is larger among boys (71% of girls and 82% of boys scored below Level 2 in reading). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrb6pkgc5z91w7jb5hj48bp))
- 28% reported feeling lonely at school, and 28% like an outsider or left out of things at school (OECD average: 16% and 17%). Compared to 2018, students’ sense of belonging at school declined in the Philippines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrb7jn6b6s06rn30m56paef))

- Many students study mathematics in a disciplinary climate that is not favourable to learning: in 2022, about 26% of students in the Philippines reported that they cannot work well in most or all lessons (OECD average: 23%); 29% of students do not listen to what the teacher says (OECD average: 30%); 41% of students get distracted using digital devices (OECD average: 30%); and 37% get distracted by other students who are using digital devices (OECD average: 25%). On average across OECD countries, students were less likely to report getting distracted using digital devices when the use of cell phones on school premises is banned.

- Some 43% of girls and 53% of boys reported being the victim of bullying acts at least a few times a month (OECD average: 20% of girls and 21% of boys). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrbcsc76va4s5ympz392q37))
- During remote learning, 41% of students in the Philippines had problems at least once a week with understanding school assignments and 34% of students with finding someone who could help them with schoolwork (OECD averages: 34% and 24%).

- Expenditure on education is related to student performance only to a certain extent. Among the countries/economies whose cumulative expenditure per student, over all primary and secondary school years between the ages of 6 and 15, was under USD 75 000 (PPP) in 2019, higher expenditure on education was associated with higher scores in the PISA mathematics test. In the Philippines, the cumulative expenditure per student, over ten years of age between 6 and 15, was equivalent to about USD 11 000 (PPP).

- In 2022, 43% of students in the Philippines were in schools whose principal reported that the school’s capacity to provide instruction is hindered by a lack of teaching staff (and 19%, by inadequate or poorly qualified teaching staff). In 2018, the corresponding proportions were 19% and 8%. In most countries/economies, students attending schools whose principal reported shortages of teaching staff scored lower in mathematics than students in schools whose principal reported fewer or no shortages of teaching staff.

- In the Philippines, 7193 students, in 188 schools, completed the assessment in mathematics, reading or science, representing about 1782 900 15-year-old students (an estimated 83% of the total population of 15-year-olds).
