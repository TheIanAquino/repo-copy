## Highlights
* The MPBL (Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League) and the GAB (Games and Amusements Board) will work together for the betterment of the league and local basketball in general. GAB Chairman Atty Richard Clarin and MPBL Commissioner Kenneth Duremdes made this commitment on Sunday during the welcome dinner tendered by the league for the 29 member teams competing in the ongoing OKBet-MPBL Fifth Season and its sponsors at the Palacio de Maynila in Malate.
* Reiterating the 3Ps (Promote, professionalize and Protect) advocacy of the agency, Clarin warned the players from getting involved in game-fixing as well as playing in Ligang Labas without informing their mother teams, the MPBL and the GAB, otherwise their licenses will either be suspended or blacklisted.
