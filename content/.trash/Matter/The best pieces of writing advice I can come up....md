## Highlights
* 14) Make up your own words.
  * **Note**: This is interesting. I need to know more about David’s insights on this.
* 1) If your ideas are boring, get a life.
  * **Note**: In other words, have better ideas by consuming better information. A better life (i.e. - reading more books, consuming quality content, listening more, etc.) gives you better ideas.
* 3) If you’re serious about becoming a better writer, do it in public.
* 6) Mentally, the most important work you can do is to silence the voice inside your head that says “people will make fun of me for this idea” before you even write it.
* 9) If you’re serious about writing, sit down at your computer every morning before the demands of the world smack you in the face.
* 17) Write at the moment of epiphany.
  * **Note**: Write immediately when an idea comes up. It doesn’t have to be a full-blown essay. Just the general thought. In a journal, a tissue – wherever.
* 20) Take more notes.
* 22) Most of the conversation about note-taking is too focused on capturing other people's ideas instead of your own epiphanies and observations.
* 23) If you're bored writing it, the reader will be bored reading it.
* 24) Your readers are a mirror of yourself. You get the ones you deserve.
* 26) A busy schedule will suffocate the writer's spirit.
* 28) These days, the hardest part of writing is trying to not get distracted by the Internet.
* 32) The paradox of creativity: Your work is done when it looks so simple that the consumer thinks they could've done it, which means they won't appreciate how hard you worked.
