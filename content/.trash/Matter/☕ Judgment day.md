## Highlights
* Germany arrested 25 right-wing extremists who were allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.
* tin can. Bigger chunks of stuff. Getting wild with noodle shapes. That’s a full list of the innovations in the soup industry over most of the last ~125 years, and it’s not exactly a recipe for rapid growth. Yet Campbell Soup Company is boiling hot after announcing better than expected earnings yesterday.
* The company revealed that organic sales (revenue outside of merger impacts) jumped 15% from the year prior, beating estimates, and that consumers responded better to inflation-based price hikes than anticipated. The soup stock (not the liquid) hit 52-week highs on the news. It’s up about 28% year to date, while the S&P 500 is down ~18%. So what’s going on with soup?
* Cheap, long-lasting foods tend to do better in economic downturns. But Campbell’s didn’t find success just by waiting for inflation to hit: Since 2019, the company has been fully leaning into innovation, using AI to comb through 300 billion data points every year in search of new product ideas.
* Musk remains “which of my jets should I take today?” loaded, with more than $185 billion in net worth, but his fortune has taken a ~$70 billion hit since he offered to pay $44 billion to make Twitter’s problems his own—mostly because Tesla stock is down about 50% this year.
* According to the Financial Times, the star’s team made it to late-stage negotiations with FTX for a $100 million sponsorship—apparently celebrity-happy FTX wanted to get involved because ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is “a fan of Tay Tay.”
* Luckily for everyone’s favorite anti-hero, she didn't end up associated with the brand because talks broke down a few months before FTX blew up.
* The price tag for keeping Swift bejeweled on tour was reportedly too high for the crypto exchange.
* Feeling apocalyptic? This game lets you launch an asteroid at Earth.
* Rock, paper, scissors: Shoot.
