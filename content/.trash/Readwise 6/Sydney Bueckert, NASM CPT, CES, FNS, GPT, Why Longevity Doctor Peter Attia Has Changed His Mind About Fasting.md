## Highlights
- studies show fasting can increase stress resistance and longevity, and decrease your risk of chronic disease—including cancer and obesity ([1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1905136)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwf31mprvv6yh90wybhpzbz))
- In his fasting era, Attia was known to do a seven-day water-only fast once a quarter, and a three-day water-only fast once a month. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwf40w4a9qztsc3ay0qrxxg))
- in a [recent interview with celebrity trainer and nutrition influencer Thomas DeLauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb6gMegtLcg), Attia shared that he’s changed his stance on fasting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwf4bh9fq4jw83hbvwsssbz))
- “While there are clearly some benefits of [fasting], it’s very difficult to measure what’s happening cellularly,” says Attia. Those benefits also come with a huge downside, decreasing muscle mass, which is why Attia hasn’t done a multi-day fast since 2020. “Today, I just don’t feel that that trade-off is worthwhile, at least at the extreme level that I was doing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwfhgfahp9vcj88885zg2zw))
- One review concluded that a major downside of fasting is the accompanying loss of muscle ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6834432/)). If there is a way to make up for this loss, Attia hasn’t found it. “As much as you might exercise during those periods of fasting, which I tried to, you’re just not going to be able to maintain lean mass,” he said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwfjm62t8h3r2rr9nd4xmay))
- Even if you don’t fast, starting at age 30, you can lose as much as three to eight percent of your muscle mass per decade ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804956/)). Muscle loss slows down your metabolism, and decreases your strength and functional ability to complete daily tasks with ease. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwfkgwghy8sswxkcwmekyas))
- “One not uncommon scenario that we see with [fasting] is that a person loses weight on the scale, but their body composition alters for worse: they lose lean mass (muscle) while their body fat stays the same or even increases,” Attia wrote in his book [*Outlive*](https://honehealth.com/edge/health/peter-attia-book-outlive-pillars-of-health/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwfmedzmph2sh7gh42rtjq6))
- Attia believes fasting is a “tool” that should only be used for the ideal candidate. That person is someone who either has a good deal of muscle to spare or someone who has over 35 percent body fat and can handle losing a little muscle because they have so much fat to lose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkwfng3gr3y62665817n8bjz))
- Fasting for longer periods comes at a price: “You are virtually guaranteed to miss your protein intake with this approach,” Attia wrote in *Outlive*. Alternatively, “sixteen hours without food simply isn’t long enough to activate [autophagy](https://honehealth.com/edge/health/what-is-autophagy-fasting/), inhibit chronic mTOR elevation (mTOR is a gene that regulates protein production and helps you build muscle, but too much is linked to diseases like diabetes and cancer ([4](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00621/full), [5](https://cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13578-020-00396-1)), or engage any other longer-term benefits of fasting we would want to obtain,” Attia said.
