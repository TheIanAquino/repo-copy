- Much of Stoicism has to do with reacting to what comes at us with equanimity and poise. But this, too, is important: Quelling and quieting that voice in your head that becomes seduced by the latest fashions or fads or must-have riches. You don’t need them. More than that, you don’t actually want them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02tnrjqw2zhdt01cyzwr8t))
    - Note: Mental calmness or composure.
