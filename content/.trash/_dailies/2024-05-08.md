Heeeeeey. I'm coding right now and tracking it using [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) so I'll come back here later to dump my thoughts. For now please go to [[dev-2024-05-08]].

Heya! It's been a while. It's now 02:35:25 PM, which is very much unusual since I usually look forward to doing this writing thing immediately as I wake up. However, today's been different. I woke up late ðŸ˜‚ and did stuff last night that I probably shouldn't have done as I went to bed. I went to bed not to rest, but to research on [digital minimalism](https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/). It's nice that I did that, but I woke up regretting it since it kinda made me groggy because I didn't immediately sleep as I felt sleepy.

I rewatched [quit social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk&pp=ygUeY2FsIG5ld3BvcnQgcXVpdCBzb2NpYWwgbWVkaWFc) from Cal Newport and it pretty much had the same effect as it had on me the first time. I ended up thinking and reflecting about my [[I'm quitting social media|social media use]], which I long have cut from my life almost completely. There have been countless times that I wanted to quit it, yet I have always come back to it like I didn't even quit at all.

And a lot of the time that I'm in this repetitive cycle, I can't help but think of myself as some sort of person without integrity. That I can't do the stuff I tell myself to do. Yet, at the same time, I feel like it's all the more important that I be kind to myself because it's not really my fault that I'm getting addicted to *these* platforms. As a matter of fact, had I not been aware of the nuanced information that I could know about the dangers of social media (how they manipulate us, trick us, and even bring us into a very dark place -- like depression), I wouldn't even know that I'd already been in a very, very bad place.

And it's interesting that I write this, since as I said, I almost always have always gone back to it before. But now, I truly, truly think it's different. More than ever, I'm starting to understand that my time is never really coming back anymore. Just [[2024-04-30#^a3995c|my recent exposure to the hospital]] made me think about my life a lot. Not just my health, but my whole freakin' life. My time, my future, and everything else. [[2024-04-30#^a3995c|I went home from the ER that night]] thinking, "Fuck, this could be one of my last days." Thankfully, the stuff I had at the time [[2024-04-30#^a780a3|weren't life-threatening]]. Despite this, however, it got me thinking about the nature of my life so far. Whenever I look at other people, they seem to have achieved more in life than I ever have. They seem to have achieved, at an age younger than me, something I couldn't see myself doing. And whenever I looked at the people I admired, I see multitudes of my potential manifested in other people. All the things I *could* be, if only I put in the effort:

>[!INFO]- A very short list of the people I admire
>- [Dr. Peter Attia, MD](https://peterattiamd.com/):
>	-  ![[2024-05-07#^fddeef]]
>- [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/writing/)
>	- ![[Pasted image 20240508145650.png]]
>- [Joe Rogan](https://www.joerogan.com/)
>	- ![[Pasted image 20240508145755.png]]
>- *And a lot more!*

If I had enough patience to extend this list, I could do it the entire day. I admire so many people for so many different reasons. And I think it's really just because of this:

>[!todo] They possess a quality I wish I had.
>It never really occurred to me until recently that being disciplined is extremely hard. I was just detailing to my girlfriend a while ago the process of [Jocko Willink](https://jocko.com/)'s daily ritual to post his watch on Instagram. When he posted his watch, it always had 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM written on it. If he doesn't post his watch, he posts what he calls an *aftermath* of his workout session -- of course, still around the same time of dawn.

Every time I saw an image posted by Jocko Willink, it always nudged me into thinking, "I can do what he does. I just choose not to."

I choose to live the *easier* live. Each time I see his watch, I get reminded that I'm living a life without structure, at the very least. Without intention. Without discipline. I just... go through the motions.

Still, I urge myself not to get discouraged by this, as I think it's never too late to start. This might sound cliche but the best we can do to move forward is to *act* -- and **act now**. In and of itself, this journaling thing I'm doing is something I have veered away from for months. Other than really tough personal challenges, I briefly went over why I quit journaling for a while [[2024-05-06#^75d965|here]] -- something about the complexity of having to re-adjust my process due to the recent changes in Obsidian, which barred me from integrating the tool *properly* into my life.

I really like this video made by Jocko Willink called "[GOOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8)." Nowadays it's one of those things that keep me going. I need not explain it here, as the way he explains why the word "good" is an art in and of itself that I think everyone should witness.

Sooo, yeah. Back to doing the things I should be doing today. I'll see this journal again later, should my need for it arise.

>[!QUOTE]- Today...
>It was *today* when I felt it. Just a while ago. I'd rather not think about it, but... when will it fade? It felt *familiar*, like she was *someone* I'd long known. Was it her hair, or her arms, or her hands, or her complexion? I'm not so sure. I see her, though she doesn't see me. Is it real, or is it not? Is it even there?
>
>I want *it* out of my life. I want it gone. Or was it just my thoughts? Should I have just shrugged it off, like it hadn't made me want to bash my head against the wall for the majority of the time that I was in the elevator? 

Whatever this is, I have a Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0BDqMSnAu62fvAOSMofxna?si=f31e8ccdeaa14ad6) for it. Bold as it may be, it's my best attempt at giving *this* feeling a form, and I hope you would appreciate it.

It's been a while since I felt it. I don't know what it is, but the closest sensible thing I could attribute to it is [limerence](https://www.simplypsychology.org/limerence.html).
