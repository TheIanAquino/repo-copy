## Highlights
- Writing online is a superpower.
  Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.
  1. The Niche Hobbyist
  The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099))
- 2. The Think-for-Yourself Academic
  Academia is hyper-specialized and often hostile to new ideas.
  On the Internet, you don’t need permission from peer reviewers before you publish your work.
  Build an audience to reduce career risk — so you can study unpopular ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612676324515842))
- 3. The Up-and-Coming Entrepreneur
  We’re moving to a world of Audience-First Products.
  Before the Internet, companies built products before audiences. Now, they build audiences before products.
  It’s easier to start a business when you have an audience.

- 4. The Underestimated Employee
  The number one predictor of entrepreneurship is asymmetric information about skill levels.
  If the market under-values your skills, and you aren’t able to demonstrate your competence at work, you can prove yourself by writing online.

- 5. The Deep Thinker
  Writing online will sharpen your thinking.
  An empty white page is a mirror into your mind. When the ideas in your mind are clouded, so are the words on the page in front of you. Re-writing is re-thinking.
  Writing is the best way to improve your ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612689175846913))
- 6. The Rural Obsessive
  You are intellectually curious, but you‘re trapped in a place where you can’t meet like-minded people.
  Write online, so people come to you.
  When they do, you can video chat with them and find ways to meet them in person.
  No more intellectual loneliness. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612690299936775))
- 7. The Job Hunter
  A well-written personal blog says more about you than any resume ever will.
  Writing demonstrates curiosity, commitment and diligence — which attracts the eye of the world’s best companies.
  Instead of reaching out to recruiters, they’ll be reaching out to you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612691319185413))
- 7. The Investor
  Investors need a competitive edge.
  Talented is globally distributed, but when you write online, people from around the world reach out to you.
  Writing online gives you the first-look at up-and-coming entrepreneurs.
  These relationships will make you smarter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227613770215755779))
- 8. The Gifted Artist
  Fans like artists who can explain the thinking behind their work.
  Write online to document your creative process and give fans a window into the madness of your mind.
  As you write, your art will become three-dimensional.
  You’ll attract die-hard fans. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227614775171076097))
- 9. The 10x Engineer
  Engineers are paid very well.
  But the best ones are STILL under-paid.
  By writing online, you can demonstrate your competence and tell the world about your unique skills.
  You’ll attract the gaze of recruiters and other engineers, who will see your worth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227616325738127360))
- Writing online is the fastest way to accelerate your career. 
  It'll help you learn faster, build your resume and meet people who can create personal and professional opportunities for you.
  Writing online is a superpower.
  This is the best place to start.

- If you’re serious about writing, you should take my writing course.
  It’s an intense five-week sprint.
  It’s built for serious people who want to seriously level up.
  The next cohort starts next week.
