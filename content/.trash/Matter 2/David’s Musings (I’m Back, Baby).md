  * **Note**: "making or constituting a disturbingly harsh and loud noise."
* Sensitivity makes you more externally perceptive, but also more internally self-aware. For proof, look no further than the reports from meditation retreats. It only takes a few days for people to notice the emotions they’d previously been ignoring. After a few more days, they can identify the stories behind those emotions and even pinpoint the exact coordinates where those emotions live in the body. The sisters of silence and reflection reveal how much the noise of modern life downs out subtle perceptions and the whispering vibrations all around us.
* The sensitivity of our senses ebbs and flows based on who we’re with and where we are. If you’re looking to be more perceptive, start by changing your environment.
