## Highlights
* Unhappiness is always the result of an outcome not meeting our expectations.
* I’d say low expectations is the solution to a lot of unhappiness. The way we value things is always based on relative percentages: am I making more or less money than last year? Are my grades going up or down? Am I going up in the world? But this desire for this kind of growth isn’t usually something we’ve usually decided to value ourselves – it’s something society foists on us.
* Never forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?
  * **Note**: A quote from Derek Sivers.
* The Comfortable Pain Principle: Give a man a tolerable job that pays just enough to provide mediocre comfort and I’ll show you a man who won’t change a damn thing.
