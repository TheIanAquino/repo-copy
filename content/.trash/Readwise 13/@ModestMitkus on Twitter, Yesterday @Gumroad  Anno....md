- First of all, let's talk about merchant of record.
  A merchant of record can handle the complexity of VAT compliance on behalf of a company. This can include tasks such as calculating and collecting VAT, filing VAT returns, and keeping accurate records of VAT transactions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ModestMitkus/status/1604459857507139584))
- Handling VAT from multiple countries take a lot of time and money so look at merchant of record as additional bonus. Not all platforms/solution offers this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ModestMitkus/status/1604459860040781824))
- Additionaly some of these platforms bellow have integrated Stripe and PayPal payment, which can cost you an additional 2.9% + 30¢. So, before deciding to switch, double-check the transaction fees ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ModestMitkus/status/1604459862771273728))
- I also divided these platforms/solutions into 3 categories:
  1. E-commerce platforms.
  Platform that you don't own.
  2. Custom e-commerce platforms.
  Platforms that you own.
  3. Payment links.
  Link to checkout page. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ModestMitkus/status/1604459865556111361))
- And lastly.
  There are numerous other solutions available online, but these are the platforms/solutions I would recommend to others.
