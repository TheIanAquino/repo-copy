## Highlights
- Metabolic syndrome greatly raises the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or all three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avvh7a6esz7xjwqx526ecd))
- **Abdominal obesity.** This means having a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women and more than 40 inches for men. An increased waist circumference is the form of obesity most strongly tied to metabolic syndrome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avw4ysq5d7rdayp0456v45))
- **High blood pressure** of 130/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or higher. Normal blood pressure is defined as less than 120 mm Hg for systolic pressure (the top number), and less than 80 mm Hg for diastolic pressure (the bottom number). High blood pressure is strongly tied to obesity. It is often found in people with insulin resistance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avwnnpz2g3nrn5qvhe048n))
- **Impaired fasting blood glucose**. This means a level equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avwwyz9vd4qtmbw6wnzeqb))
- **High triglyceride levels** of more than 150 mg/dL. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avx3p1nagdagdq7eqqeybk))
- **Low HDL (good) cholesterol.** Less than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 50 mg/dL for women is considered low. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2avxcn8zyejzv4vmja48ttn))
- Most people who have metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw1zjzsrgxv1sj9c47d3rb))
- The body makes insulin to move glucose (sugar) into cells for use as energy. Obesity, commonly found in people with metabolic syndrome, makes it more difficult for cells in the body to respond to insulin. If the body canâ€™t make enough insulin to override the resistance, the blood sugar level increases, causing type 2 diabetes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw3gvsbtgn2hq944nsvn8p))
- Metabolic syndrome may be a start of the development of type 2 diabetes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw3qy7n84wc6fpr8s5zrss))
- the American Heart Association (AHA) has estimated that metabolic syndrome soon will become the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease, ahead of cigarette smoking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw5rkdtqjtn76wx1nq93qq))
- Obesity plus a sedentary lifestyle contributes to risk factors for metabolic syndrome. These include high cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure. These risk factors may lead to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw75hc7v5rjja57vcyp2ha))
- Others believe that hormone changes caused by chronic stress lead to abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and higher blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw7vkkp64k49a9qb6kzq0y))
- Age. You are more likely to have metabolic syndrome the older you are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw8zw2jtx3g6agtzh9pten))
    - Note: One risk factor of metabolic syndrome is age.
- Body mass index (BMI) greater than 25. The BMI is a measure of body fat compared with height and weight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aw9cp34k82xtdr6yrs81tn))
    - Note: Risk factor of metabolic syndrome. I donâ€™t know my current BMI, but I should check it ASAP.
- Personal or family history of diabetes. Women who have had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) or people who have a family member with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk for metabolic syndrome ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awbwdvz5kqgx1m4f84atg9))
    - Note: Me. Our family. I need to look into this.
- Smoking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awcdrbm43q7m5zc2dp1eja))
    - Note: Another risk factor for metabolic syndrome. I have a long history of smoking cigarettes.
- Stress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awda52gtxtgqf7g6sberg6))
    - Note: Another risk factor.
- High-fat diet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awddam7ewpew9pm3ctkgmc))
    - Note: Risk factor.
- Sedentary lifestyle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awdhcxhw8xedqtdmvkvw7p))
    - Note: Risk factor.
- Having high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and being overweight or obese may be signs of metabolic syndrome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awefr4dxp7rgxkad8s6hmj))
- People with insulin resistance may have acanthosis nigricans. This is darkened skin areas on the back of the neck, in the armpits, and under the breasts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awgqrnshjweqbze8q91kc3))
- Other conditions that may develop as a result of metabolic syndrome include:
  â€¢ Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
  â€¢ Fatty liver
  â€¢ Cholesterol gallstones
  â€¢ Asthma
  â€¢ Sleep problems
  â€¢ Some forms of cancer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awn0h617q4esa7arws146y))
- Treatment usually involves lifestyle changes. This means losing weight, working with a dietitian to change your diet, and getting more exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awnr5agt52gp2c90q7sq2r))
- Losing weight increases HDL ("good") cholesterol and lowers LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awp0dshfxspmv34ha54p0a))
- Losing weight can also reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awp2x6n4p0zgw2svdgtht8))
- Losing even a modest amount of weight can lower blood pressure and increase sensitivity to insulin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awph66jpyd2yhz76ddqec9))
- Changes in diet are important in treating metabolic syndrome. According to the AHA, treating insulin resistance is the key to changing other risk factors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awt9m46hxb5yyp1btm72cv))
- In general, the best way to treat insulin resistance is by losing weight and getting more physical activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awtdnwz4h3j7wvz36kc5t8))
- Use healthy fats. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may help keep your heart healthy. These healthy fats are found in nuts, seeds, and some types of oils, such as olive, safflower, and canola. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awvtp9e32r4crdst64czh4))
- Choose whole grains such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread instead of white rice and white bread. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2aww194gteam3czqt6b407f))
- Whole-grain foods are rich in nutrients compared with more processed foods. Whole grains are higher in fiber, so the body absorbs them more slowly. They do not cause a rapid spike in insulin, which can trigger hunger and cravings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awwj9rrv27segk7fj3t0z8))
- Eat more fruits and vegetables. According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, a person on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet should eat 2.5 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruit a day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awxnbtw4bk8zs95q70tp6h))
- Be sure to choose a variety of fruits and vegetables. Different fruits and vegetables have different amounts and types of nutrients. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awxyc4n85z6zcmv1aanjy3))
- Read food labels carefully. Pay close attention to the number of servings in the product and the serving size. If the label says a serving is 150 calories but the number of servings per container is 3 and you eat the entire container, you are getting 450 calories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2awz2vwswmdhhrq0qd1q44w))
    - Note: Iâ€™ve been doing this a lot, and I must say it helps a lot.
- Metabolic syndrome greatly raises the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or all three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ax1saw777pw4dqsvs36bh0))
- The best way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to maintain a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet, and be physically active. Your diet should have little salt, sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ax20xpk76cs2vj2hx252d7))
    - Note: Basically my diet before for four (4) months straight when I lost 15 kg! ðŸ¥¹
- Metabolic syndrome is a lifelong condition that will require changes in your lifestyle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ax3dnmzkrk9dsp4wf9h7vt))
    - Note: Emphasis on lifelong! This shouldnâ€™t be taken lightly!
