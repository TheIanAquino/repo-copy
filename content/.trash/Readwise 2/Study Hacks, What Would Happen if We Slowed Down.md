- Summary: Many knowledge workers are consistently overloaded, working roughly 20% more than they can comfortably handle. This creates a background stress that is sustained over time. The reason for this overload is that knowledge workers are left to self-regulate their workload, and they tend to say "no" only when they feel stressed. However, what would happen if they aimed to work 20% less than they had time for? The author suggests that it might not have as much of a negative impact on their professional life as they fear. However, not enough people are asking these questions and considering the benefits of slowing down and reducing workload.

- We care a lot about doing well with the work on our plate (as we should), but not nearly enough about asking how big that plate should be in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxjrqs8qqy00fdgm0tv5q79d))
    - Note: I really would've loved to see some statistics that could support his claims. It seems I'm reading a prose that doesn't have anything to buttress it, and I'm uncomfortable with that.
