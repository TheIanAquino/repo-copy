- **Document Note:** The paper provides a classification scheme for match fixing based on types of behavior, which could potentially help identify the agents responsible for each type. Specifically, the paper categorizes match fixing into four types based on financial involvement and scope of human networks: organization-based, relationship-based, sustenance-based, and goal-based match fixing. The paper also suggests variables intrinsic and extrinsic to a match game that should be examined and screened according to the type of match fixing. Therefore, the paper could be useful for your research regarding the agents responsible for match fixing behavior.
  According to the paper, "How should sports match fixing be classified?", match fixing can be categorized into four types based on two dimensions: monetary involvement and scope of the human network. The four types are:
  1. Organization-based match fixing with money involved within an internal-external human network.
  2. Relationship-based match fixing with the involvement of an internal-external human network without monetary involvement.
  3. Sustenance-based match fixing with money involved within an internal human network.
  4. Goal-based match fixing with the involvement of an internal human network without monetary involvement.
  The paper provides further details and examples for each type of match fixing.
  The result of the methodology described in the document is a classification scheme for different types of sports match fixing behavior based on financial gain and the scope of the human network involved. The document provides a detailed explanation and examples of each type of match fixing behavior.
  The methodology used in the study mentioned in the document involves analyzing the concept of match fixing as defined by the International Olympic Committee and creating a classification scheme based on four types of match fixing behavior. The study aims to classify sports match fixing based on the scope of human network and financial involvement. It uses a systematic literature review and deductive approaches to find cases that conform to the two dimensions of match fixing. The study categorizes match fixing into four types and provides a foundation for systematic analysis of a practice that threatens the existence of sports.
  The objective of the paper "How should sports match fixing be classified?" is to classify the types of match fixing that occur in sports. The paper aims to create a classification scheme based on the types of match fixing behavior and to establish appropriate coping strategies for each type of match fixing behavior.
  The idea of match-fixing, especially within sports, is dealt with in the article. The author, Jae-Hyeon Park, points to a framework that could potentially be used to support legal efforts to eradicate match-fixing practices.
  The article's suggested framework or scheme is supported by two factors: financial benefits and the broader human network.
  There are four different types of match-fixing outlined in the article. 
  These are, specifically, as follows: 
  1) Organization-based - this kind of match-fixing involves financial considerations. It primarily interacts with a human network that is internal and external.
  2) Based on relationships. Akin to method number 1, this kind of match-fixing relies on an internal-external human network but doesn't involve money.
  3) Support-based. It includes financial components and operates within an internal human network.
  4) Goal-based. This is a match-fixing classification that functions within an internal human network but without the involvement of money.

## Highlights
- Most people would agree with the general definition of match fixing as athletes who deliberately do not work to their maximum ability in the competitions. However, it is also true that athletes commonly do not perform to their maximum ability in some competitions on purpose. For example, in general, the world’s top-class runners competing in a 100 m race do not run to their fullest capacity in a qualifying competition. In addition, in Olympic or FIFA World Cup soccer matches, it is a common practice to allow reserve players to play games remaining after the top 16 teams have been determined in qualifying contests, so as to prevent injuries and maintain peak conditions of main players in the knockout stages as part of longer-term strategies (Torio & Ghani, 2018).

- Pielke (2012) argued that the decision on whether an incident is a match fixing case is made from a subjective point of view because the current definition of match fixing by international sports organizations is vague. A vague definition of match fixing makes it unclear which behavior falls under match fixing, and accordingly, the question about which behavior should be carefully managed to prevent match fixing cannot be answered.

- The presence of different subjective perspectives in defining match fixing may result from a lack of a clear conceptualization of this issue. A definition of match fixing in sports can be limited to behavior related to financial gain (Bag & Saha, 2011; Forrest & Simmons, 2003) or can be more extensive by also including behavior irrelevant to financial gain.

- International sports organizations, like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), define match fixing as behavior that damages the fundamental value of sports, namely, the uncertainty of outcomes, and that is a threat to sports (Chappelet, 2015).
