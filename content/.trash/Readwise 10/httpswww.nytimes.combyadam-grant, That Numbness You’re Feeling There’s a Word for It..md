## Highlights
- inaction isn’t always caused by apathy. It can also be the product of empathy. More specifically, it can be the result of what psychologists call [empathic distress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214007702): hurting for others while feeling unable to help. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkvfnrt1mggnfs6mw81nstc))
- a hornet’s nest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkvnxx4jfmvaddv4vn0eb2f))
    - Note: From Cambridge Dictionary: “a very difficult or unpleasant situation, especially in which a lot of people get very angry and complain.”
- In times of sustained anguish, empathy is a recipe for more distress, and in some cases even [depression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pchj.482). What we need instead is compassion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkvx19w6jrrvbkdmtj9g8ah))
- Although they’re often used interchangeably, empathy and compassion [aren’t the same](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-46141-001). Empathy absorbs others’ emotions as your own: “I’m hurting for you.” Compassion focuses your action on [their emotions](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-46141-001): “I see that you’re hurting, and I’m here for you.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkvya7p1916f3dt4894xz0b))
- Another difference is that empathy makes us ache. Neuroscientists can see it in brain scans. Dr. Klimecki, Dr. Singer and their colleagues [trained](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/6/873/1669505) people to empathize by trying to feel other people’s pain. When the participants saw someone suffering, it activated a neural network that would light up if they themselves were in pain. It hurt. And when people can’t help, they [escape](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1754073919838609) the pain by withdrawing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkvza1e5mdxyzre1db7b0by))
- a growing body of evidence suggests that compassion is [healthier for you](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-72671-001) and [kinder to others](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-46141-001) than empathy: When you see others in pain, instead of causing you to get overloaded and retreat, compassion motivates you to reach out and help. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkw0bva4f9g2rj4nbkmkgqx))
- The most basic form of compassion is not assuaging distress but acknowledging it. When we can’t make people feel better, we can [still](https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0001194) make a difference by making them feel seen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkkw2bn594e73234sygm06va))
