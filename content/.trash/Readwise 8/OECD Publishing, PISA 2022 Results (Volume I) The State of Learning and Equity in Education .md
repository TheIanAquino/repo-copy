## Highlights
- The effects of socio-economic status on student achievement are well-known, and specific economic and cultural mechanisms linking studentsâ€™ socio-economic status and achievement have been studied extensively (Bourdieu, 1986[10]; Coleman, 1988[11]; Paino and Renzulli, 2012[12]; Kao and Thompson, 2003[13]; Eriksson et al., 2021[14]).
