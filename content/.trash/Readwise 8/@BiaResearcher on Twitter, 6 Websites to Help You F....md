## Highlights
- 6 websites to help you find (and analyse) the right academic literature. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BiaResearcher/status/1587712220405841920))
- 1/ Google Scholar
  Just like Google search, but for academic papers.
  Use it to:
  - Find free PDF copies of papers
  - See other papers from same author
  - Quickly check the citations network

- 2/ Semantic Scholar 
  Search papers through citation networks.
  Use it to:
  - Find the influence of a single paper
  - Learn how influential an author is
  - Find authors with related topics

- @SemanticScholar 3/ Research Rabbit
  Search often goes like this:
  you open a paper..
  you check a reference..
  you look into cited authors..
  you open yet another paper..
  then..
  you are lost.
  @RsrchRabbit lets you dive into the rabbit hole, while leaving a trail back.

- @SemanticScholar @RsrchRabbit 4/ Elicit
  Ask rather than search.
  Elicit (@elicitorg) will search the papers but will also try to extract the key details for you.
  That makes it easier to:
  - Have an overview of an area
  - Select which papers to read

- @SemanticScholar @RsrchRabbit @elicitorg 5/ Scite (@scite)
  Check if a paper supports, contrasts or just mentions another.
  Use it to:
  - Find exactly where papers agree/disagree
  - Group papers based on the argument they support

- @SemanticScholar @RsrchRabbit @elicitorg @scite 6/ Connected Papers
  Navigate through a network of similar papers.
  Most websites let you navigate through citation networks. @ConnectedPapers finds similar papers instead.
  Use it to:
  - Find similar works to a seed paper
  - Achieve conceptual saturation

- @SemanticScholar @RsrchRabbit @elicitorg @scite @ConnectedPapers Conceptual.. what?
  Conceptual Saturation is the point when you are learning no new information.
  At that moment, you can assume there is nothing new to learn from that area.
  THAT is the goal for a literature review. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BiaResearcher/status/1587712365101023232))
- @SemanticScholar @RsrchRabbit @elicitorg @scite @ConnectedPapers Here is the list of academic search websites again:
  1/ Google Scholar
  2/ Semantic Scholar
  3/ Research Rabbit
  4/ Elicit
