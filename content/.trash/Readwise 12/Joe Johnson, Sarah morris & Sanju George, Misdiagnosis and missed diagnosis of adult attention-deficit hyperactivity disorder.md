- Summary: ADHD in adults is often misdiagnosed or missed in general psychiatric settings. This article highlights some reasons for this, including lack of awareness among clinicians and the belief that hyperactivity symptoms must be present for a diagnosis. Adults with ADHD may avoid seeking help due to stigma and may develop ways of compensating for their difficulties. Age-related changes in symptoms and overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric conditions can also result in misdiagnosis. It is important for ADHD to be considered as a possible diagnosis to ensure appropriate support and treatment.
