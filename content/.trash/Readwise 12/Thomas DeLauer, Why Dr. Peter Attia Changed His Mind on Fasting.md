- Category: #articles
- Summary: Dr. Peter Attia discusses several topics he has changed his mind on over the past five years. He used to believe in the importance of regular fasting, but now feels that the trade-off of losing muscle mass outweighs the benefits. He also had a change of heart about GMOs and now has concerns about the long-term effects of glyphosate. He has gained a deeper appreciation for the power of exercise and its effects on various systems in the body. Lastly, he used to take metformin as a preventive measure but now questions its efficacy as a protective molecule.
