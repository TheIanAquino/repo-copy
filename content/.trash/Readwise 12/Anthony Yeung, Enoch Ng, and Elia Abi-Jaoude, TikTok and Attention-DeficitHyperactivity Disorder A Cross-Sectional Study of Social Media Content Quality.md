- Document Note: In the study entitled "TikTok and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Cross-Sectional Study of Social Media Content Quality," videos were classified as "misleading" if they contained information lacking scientific evidence, such as unsubstantiated claims about treating ADHD. This classification was made by one psychiatrist and one psychiatry resident with clinical experience in the diagnosis and management of ADHD independently. If a personal experience video additionally contained any generalized misleading statements, it was classified as misleading rather than personal experience. The study aimed to analyze and assess the content quality of social media videos related to ADHD on TikTok.

- Summary: In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated the quality of TikTok videos about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They analyzed the top 100 most popular videos about ADHD on TikTok and classified them as misleading, personal experience, or useful. The study found that approximately 52% of the videos were misleading, 27% were personal experience, and 21% were useful. Healthcare providers uploaded higher quality and more useful videos compared to non-healthcare providers. The study highlights the widespread dissemination of health misinformation on social media platforms and its potential impact on clinical care.

- Method: The top 100 most popular videos about ADHD uploaded by TikTok video creators were classiﬁed as misleading, useful, or personal experience. Descriptive and quantitative characteristics of the videos were obtained. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-A/V) and Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria were used to assess the overall quality, understandability, and actionability of the videos.

- Results: Of the 100 videos meeting inclusion criteria, 52% (n= 52) were classiﬁed as misleading, 27% (n= 27) as personal experience, and 21% (n= 21) as useful. Classiﬁcation agreement between clinician ratings was 86% (kappa statistic of 0.7766). Videos on the platform were highly understandable by viewers but had low actionability. Non-healthcare providers uploaded the majority of misleading videos. Healthcare providers uploaded higher quality and more useful videos, compared to non-healthcare providers.

Clinicians should be aware of the widespread dissemination of health misinformation on social media platforms and its potential impact on clinical care.
