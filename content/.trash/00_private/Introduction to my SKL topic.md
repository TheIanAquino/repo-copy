Hi, since my SKL Friday would be far into the future pa (wow ganon ba talaga kalayo)...

Just wanted to share a glimpse of what Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) -- which is my topic -- could do, potentially, if you're interested enough:

ðŸ”´ LINK: https://theianaquino.github.io/public-journal/

Quick context: It's a personal website I made through the help of a static site generator (which I know sounds kinda technical, it requires a bit of coding knowledge, pero trust me when I say I only have surface-level knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS lol, the majority of the code is made by a cool fellow named Jacky Zhao.)

When I say PKM is my hobby, this is what I mean... like what you see in the website though all data is stored locally, through an application called Obsidian -- and obviously the layout of Obsidian is different. 

But the cool thing is they're not dependent on Obsidian since they're in the Markdown (.md) format, which means they're just plain text! So can access my info in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VSCode, Sublime, or any plain text editors like Notepad. This means I could still access my data as long as basic computing exists, so a Nokia 3310 would be just as effective (not efficient, though) in reading my notes, when compared to a modern PC.
