# What are my values?

And lastly, I would want you to know about my values.

I could direct you to an entirely specific and separate resource for my values sheet. However, I would like for you to have a quick (rather than exhaustive) overview of who I am as a person. In doing that, I present to you a well-crafted Artificial Intelligence (AI) summary of my values, which ChatGPT has so wonderfully crafted:

>[!FAQ]- A quick context regarding my stance on Artificial Intelligence (AI).
>I'm definitely *for* it, given some restrictions which I would love to highlight in another piece of writing. For now, it is important that you understand that I value *efficiency* over anything else, especially in this busy world, where our time is the most precious, *unrenewable* resource we have. 
>
>I've gotten multiple positive uses out of AI, and I am using it daily to *enhance* my life. I have no plans of stopping it, unless I am presented with a compelling reason to do so.


>[!QUOTE] An AI summary of my values
>My values revolve around optimizing my time, health, wealth, and relationships to achieve a balanced and fulfilling life. In terms of time, I prioritize productivity through focused work, rest periods, and commitment to my goals. I actively engage in personal growth through self-reflection and nurture my creativity through design and writing. My curiosity drives me to continuously read and explore new ideas. In health, I make conscious lifestyle choices, such as ensuring adequate sleep and managing my diet across both digital and physical realms, to maintain overall well-being. Regarding wealth, I value passion projects, personal branding, and mindful spending, including proper allocation of resources. Lastly, I emphasize the importance of relationshipsâ€”both romantic and familialâ€”by cherishing quality time, physical touch, and meaningful interactions with my loved ones.
