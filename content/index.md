# Wtf is this?

**Welcome to Alexander's Thoughts**, a dedicated online space for my thoughts to live in.

I'm Ian, a 22-year-old [graphic designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theianaquino1/) from the Philippines. 

I'm pursuing a BAMMA (Bachleor of Arts in Multimedia Arts) at [CIIT Philippines](https://www.ciit.edu.ph/) and, at the same time, I've been working at [Hatch Corporate Solutions](https://www.instagram.com/hatch.solutions/?hl=en) as a graphic designer for already more than a year. 

I have years of experience working in the creative industry, both as a freelancer and formal employee. If you're interested about my design work, here's my partial clientele within both the agency and freelance setting:

For my creative work, you can check out my portfolio (TBA).

# What about this website?

^2b7233

The short answer is I made this website originally to write about whatever the fuck I want. The long answer is that I've a bunch of interests, much to my chagrin: design, 3D, business, writing, plus a shit-ton more... and I need a channel through which I can yap about those. ^c43217

The thing is [[I'm quitting social media|I don't like social media that much]], so I chose a blog. Some may call what I'm building as a [[digital garden]], but I think of it more as a public journal. Like I said above:

>...a dedicated online space for my thoughts to live in.

I just want a safe space where I could dump whatever the heck it is that I want, without the pressures of having this many likes, this many followers, this many positive comments and all that bullshit. All I want is to talk about what I want to talk about, yet at the same time not give a shit about what people have to think, or say, or criticize about myself.

I want this space to be one that allows my brain develop its own interests without any external pressure from any stupid vanity metric.

Plus, I get to share the more important (can be positive or negative!) moments of my life to those who so willingly remain curious, and to those who go out of their way to find this link in whichever place it could be found.

As you probably could pick up on my [[I'm quitting social media|blog post]] regarding quitting social media, I cringe to the idea of broadcasting my life to the public, as if it was something people *needed* to know about. As if they needed to know that I felt this way at this exact timestamp, that I meant to say this rather than that, that I ate fucking corn for breakfast, and that I liked Taylor Swift's new album and shit:

I just... want to be genuine.

And that's all. That's all there is to this website (or at least that's all there is to what I want this website to be) -- a place where I could be unequivocally honest.

And if that's something you're interested in, then feel free to browse around and let your curiosity take you wherever. I can't promise it'll be fun, but I promise I'll bore you out of your mind because you'd soon realize that this website isn't like how everyone else builds their website to be.

And I have nothing to sell to you, unfortunately.

So, dear reader, where to next?

If you don't know where to go next, I recommend checking out my highlights on several materials (articles, books, podcasts, tweets, videos, and whatnot), which you can find on the Explorer, to the left of your screen. 

My highlights come from applications called [Matter](https://web.getmatter.com/referral/4gs6wuqe) and [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/ian161), respectively (I'll probably write something about this soon, if you're interested).


> [!WARNING] Reminder
> Some contents in the highlights section aren't manually maintained, so if a few of them are broken (like some links, for example), I ask for your patience as they're really not within my area of interest to fix at the moment. Maybe in the future, but I highly doubt. This is because **Readwise** and **Matter** compile the direct links (oftentimes from newsletters) from my inbox. At that point, if that said link is inaccessible to you, it becomes dead for everyone else *except* the receiver.
