## Highlights
* By expecting and anticipating the troubles that inevitably attend to any worthwhile endeavor, we are more likely to be able to push through them.
* Edison was saying, as the Stoics do, that passion is not sufficient. That burst of energy is great but real success and real power does not come from being whipped up by enthusiasm. Instead, it’s pushed forward by sustained effort and discipline.
* Let others get giddy today—while you yourself are gritty.
* Develop and articulate a real purpose and practice for yourself, leave passion for the amateurs and the narcissists. Don’t expect things to be easy, know that they will be hard. Be ready for that, look forward to it even.
