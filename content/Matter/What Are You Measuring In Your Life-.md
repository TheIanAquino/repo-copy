## Highlights
* Keep a decision journal to track which decisions you make and whether or not they align with your ethics.
  * **Note**: This is something I’ve heavily been thinking about.
* Not tracking your progress is one of the six major mistakes I see people make in the gym.
* here’s the thing: We all have areas of life that we say are important to us, but that we aren’t measuring.
* What We Measure, We Improve
* Count something. Regardless of what one ultimately does in medicine—or outside of medicine, for that matter—one should be a scientist in this world. In the simplest terms, this means one should count something. … It doesn’t really matter what you count. You don’t need a research grant. The only requirement is that what you count should be interesting to you.
* The things we measure are the things we improve.
* Our lives are shaped by how we choose to spend our time and energy each day.
* Some people just love working out for the sake of working out. Measuring every repetition might reduce the satisfaction and make it seem more like a job.
  * **Note**: James Clear’s caveat to measuring everything.
* Measurement won’t solve everything. It is not an ultimate answer to life. However, it is a way to track something critical: are you showing up in the areas that you say are important to you?
