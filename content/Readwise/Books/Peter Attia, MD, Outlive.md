## Highlights
- whizzing
    - Note: move quickly through the air with a whirring sound.
- There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in.
  —Bishop Desmond Tutu
- EKG
    - Note: Electrocardiogram. From Google (Wikipedia): “Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram, a recording of the heart's electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles. It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin.”
- pulmonary embolism
    - Note: From Mayo Clinic: “A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung.”
- Cancer doesn’t care how rich you are. Or who your surgeon is, really. If it wants to find a way to kill you, it will.
- duck out
    - Note: From Merriam Webster: “To leave suddenly and usually without telling anyone that one is leaving. We ducked out after the first act of the play. often + on or of. They ducked out on us without even saying goodbye.”
- Barring some major breakthrough that, somehow, someway, reverses two billion years of evolutionary history and frees us from time’s arrow, everyone and everything that is alive today will inevitably die. It’s a one-way street.
- notching
    - Note: Score or achieve something.
- Assuming that you’re not someone who engages in ultrarisky behaviors like BASE jumping, motorcycle racing, or texting and driving, the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction.
- Longevity has two components. The first is how long you live, your chronological lifespan, but the second and equally important part is how well you live—the quality of your years. This is called healthspan
- Healthspan is typically defined as the period of life when we are free from disability or disease
- the only way to create a better future for yourself—to set yourself on a better trajectory—is to start thinking about it and taking action now.
    - Note: One of Peter Attia’s core principles.
- One of the main obstacles in anyone’s quest for longevity is the fact that the skills that my colleagues and I acquired during our medical training have proved to be far more effective against fast death than slow death. We learned to fix broken bones, wipe out infections with powerful antibiotics, support and even replace damaged organs, and decompress serious spine or brain injuries. We had an amazing ability to save lives and restore full function to broken bodies, even reviving patients who were nearly dead. But we were markedly less successful at helping our patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, or neurological disease, evade slow death. We could relieve their symptoms, and often delay the end slightly, but it didn’t seem as if we could reset the clock the way we could with acute problems.
- The problem is not that we aren’t trying. Modern medicine has thrown an unbelievable amount of effort and resources at each of these diseases. But our progress has been less than stellar, with the possible exception of cardiovascular disease, where we have cut mortality rates by two-thirds in the industrialized world in about sixty years (although there’s more yet to do, as we will see). Death rates from cancer, on the other hand, have hardly budged in the more than fifty years since the War on Cancer was declared, despite hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of public and private spending on research. Type 2 diabetes remains a raging public health crisis, showing no sign of abating, and Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative diseases stalk our growing elderly population, with virtually no effective treatments on the horizon.
- While the prevalence of each of the Horsemen diseases increases sharply with age, they typically begin much earlier than we recognize, and they generally take a very long time to kill you. Even when someone dies “suddenly” of a heart attack, the disease had likely been progressing in their coronary arteries for two decades. Slow death moves even more slowly than we realize.
- The logical conclusion is that we need to step in sooner to try to stop the Horsemen in their tracks—or better yet, prevent them altogether.
- The standard-of-care treatment guidelines of the American Diabetes Association specify that a patient can be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when they return a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test result[*1] of 6.5 percent or higher, corresponding to an average blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL (normal is more like 100 mg/dL, or an HbA1c of 5.1 percent).
    - Note: 1. HbA1 c measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in the blood, which allows us to estimate the patient's average level of blood glucose over the past ninety days or so.
- I believe that our goal should be to act as early as possible, to try to prevent people from developing type 2 diabetes and all the other Horsemen. We should be proactive instead of reactive in our approach. Changing that mindset must be our first step in attacking slow death. We want to delay or prevent these conditions so that we can live longer without disease, rather than lingering with disease.
- atherosclerosis
    - Note: A disease of the arteries characterized by the deposition of plaques of fatty material on their inner walls. See also atheroma and arteriosclerosis.
- gerontology
    - Note: The scientific study of old age, the process of aging, and the particular problems of old people.
- Each one of the Horsemen is cumulative, the product of multiple risk factors adding up and compounding over time. Many of these same individual risk factors, it turns out, are relatively easy to reduce or even eliminate. Even better, they share certain features or drivers in common that make them vulnerable to some of the same tactics and behavioral changes we will discuss in this book.
  Medicine’s biggest failing is in attempting to treat all these conditions at the wrong end of the timescale—after they are entrenched—rather than before they take root. As a result, we ignore important warning signs and miss opportunities to intervene at a point where we still have a chance to beat back these diseases, improve health, and potentially extend lifespan.
- The typical cholesterol panel that you receive and discuss at your annual physical, along with many of the underlying assumptions behind it (e.g., “good” and “bad” cholesterol), is misleading and oversimplified to the point of uselessness. It doesn’t tell us nearly enough about your actual risk of dying from heart disease—and we don’t do nearly enough to stop this killer.
- Millions of people are suffering from a little-known and underdiagnosed liver condition that is a potential precursor to type 2 diabetes. Yet people at the early stages of this metabolic derangement will often return blood test results in the “normal” range. Unfortunately, in today’s unhealthy society, “normal” or “average” is not the same as “optimal.”
- The metabolic derangement that leads to type 2 diabetes also helps foster and promote heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. Addressing our metabolic health can lower the risk of each of the Horsemen.
- Almost all “diets” are similar: they may help some people but prove useless for most. Instead of arguing about diets, we will focus on nutritional biochemistry—how the combinations of nutrients that you eat affect your own metabolism and physiology, and how to use data and technology to come up with the best eating pattern for you.
- One macronutrient, in particular, demands more of our attention than most people realize: not carbs, not fat, but protein becomes critically important as we age.
- Exercise is by far the most potent longevity “drug.” No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But most people don’t do nearly enough—and exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good.
- striving for physical health and longevity is meaningless if we ignore our emotional health. Emotional suffering can decimate our health on all fronts, and it must be addressed.
- dissuading
    - Note: persuade (someone) not to take a particular course of action.
- In finance and banking, understanding risk is key to survival. Great investors do not take on risk blindly; they do so with a thorough knowledge of both risk and reward.
- The trouble began with Hippocrates. Most people are familiar with the ancient Greek’s famous dictum: “First, do no harm.” It succinctly states the physician’s primary responsibility, which is to not kill our patients or do anything that might make their condition worse instead of better. Makes sense. There are only three problems with this: (a) Hippocrates never actually said these words,[*1] (b) it’s sanctimonious bullshit, and (c) it’s unhelpful on multiple levels.
- During one of the last trauma calls I took as a resident, a seventeen-year-old kid came in with a single stab wound in his upper abdomen, just below his xiphoid process, the little piece of cartilage at the bottom end of his sternum. He seemed to be stable when he rolled in, but then he started acting odd, becoming very anxious. A quick ultrasound suggested he might have some fluid in his pericardium, the tough fibrous sac around the heart. This was now a full-blown emergency, because if enough fluid collected in there, it would stop his heart and kill him within a minute or two.
  There was no time to take him up to the OR; he could easily die on the elevator ride. As he lost consciousness, I had to make a split-second decision to cut into his chest right then and there and slice open his pericardium to relieve the pressure on his heart. It was stressful and bloody, but it worked, and his vital signs soon stabilized. No doubt the procedure was hugely risky and caused him great short-term harm, but had I not done it, he might have died waiting for a safer and more sterile procedure in the operating room. Fast death waits for no one.
  The reason I had to act so dramatically in the moment was that the risk was so asymmetric: doing nothing—avoiding “harm”—would likely have resulted in his death. Conversely, even if I was wrong in my diagnosis, the hasty chest surgery we performed was quite survivable, though obviously not how one might wish to spend a Wednesday night. After we got him out of imminent danger, it became clear that the tip of the knife had just barely punctured his pulmonary artery, a simple wound that took two stitches to fix once he was stabilized and in the OR. He went home four nights later.
- Risk is not something to be avoided at all costs; rather, it’s something we need to understand, analyze, and work with. Every single thing we do, in medicine and in life, is based on some calculation of risk versus reward.
- sometimes doing nothing is the riskiest choice of all.
- opined
    - Note: Hold and state as one’s opinion.
- You can’t use a tool that has not yet been invented.
- Consider the case of poor Ignaz Semmelweis, a Viennese obstetrician who was troubled by the fact that so many new mothers were dying in the hospital where he worked. He concluded that their strange “childbed fever” might somehow be linked to the autopsies that he and his colleagues performed in the mornings, before delivering babies in the afternoons—without washing their hands in between. The existence of germs had not yet been discovered, but Semmelweis nonetheless believed that the doctors were transmitting something to these women that caused their illness. His observations were most unwelcome. His colleagues ostracized him, and Semmelweis died in an insane asylum in 1865.
- The next step is crucial: rigorously testing that hypothesis/guess to determine whether it is correct, also known as experimenting.
