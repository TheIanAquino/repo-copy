**Garden**:
*Oxford Dictionary* definition:
>a small piece of ground used to grow vegetables, fruit, herbs, or flowers.

The word *digital* in this case is already self-explanatory.

>The term digital garden pertains to a place wherein I could plant ideas. 

Now, the verb gardening is not merely limited to growing plants. Gardening could also be cutting grass, removing roots, trimming extraneous leaves from plants, etc.

Hence, the *plants* that I tend to in a digital garden are ideas that I would cut, trim, discard and develop over the long term.
