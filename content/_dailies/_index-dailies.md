# What is Dailies?

> [!NOTE] Fun Fact!
> Just a few days ago I came across a video of [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/) where she briefly talked about this cool little thing she saw online. She found a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) where the owner basically has been updating things he's learned every day, for the past few years. It's entitled "TIL", or Today I Learned. 
> 
> Here's a description written in the repository by the owner himself, **[jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud)**: 
> 
> > A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by [Learning In Publicâ„¢](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9) and pairing with smart people at Hashrocket."

  >As of writing, the list is continually growing, with "1423 TILs and counting."
  
  
TIL is the inspiration of this part of the public journal. I want to, as much as possible, write about the things I learn. "But why?" You may ask. Well, the reasons are a bit *selfish*, if you may. For one, I feel like I would gain more mastery over a topic if I write (and write extensively) about it. Second, I want this space to be my *personal* space, and that means I can write about whatever interests me. And third, I want to share my learnings with the people who might come across my website.
  
But Dailies is a bit different. I want the highlight of this part of the journal to be my daily writing, not daily learning. The only thing that I want to keep in mind as I enter this part of my public journal is writing any fucking thing that comes to mind. Literally anything. It's just so that I could develop the habit of writing **every. single. day.**
  
I'd like to think of it as some sort of self-imposed accountability partner. Although no one probably cares that I'm writing this, that I plan on embarking on this huge-ass writing thing on a daily basis, I don't give a shit. I'll still write. A major part of it, I suppose, is to build character. And if you think of it, it could be partly just for fun. Either way, it does more good than harm, and I'm in it purely for the benefits that I'll get in the long run.

Plus, I'm already an avid note-taker anyways, so what am I on about all these self-help shit. I just like writing -- that's the majority of it.
  
So, here it is. Behold, my pretentious attempt at writing about my own little world (and whatever else I want -- or don't want), **"Dailies"**.
