Hi there! I just finished doing this thing using templater. It's a fancy little plugin that uses JavaScript to output cool little strings that I can use to automate my note-taking. I know it's probably not interesting to someone who doesn't like to think about automation and systems and stuff like that, but I find it really cool that something like it exists. I'm starting to really think that I should've been a some sort of tech engineer (like a coder/programmer) instead, since I find these things really fun.

Anyway, here's a screenshot of it -- my Dailies entry template:

Here's what it does, step by step:
1. It creates a YAML-based title based on the existing file title, using `<% tp.file.title %>`. 
2. It specifies the note as ready to be published, by default, based on the `draft` metadata (which I can change whenever I want by typing in true or false. 
3. It formulates the file creation date using `<% tp.file.creation_date("YYYY-MM-DD" %>`, which outputs the creation date with the specific format of `YYY-MM-DD`. 
4. It classifies a `last-modifed` metadata through `<% tp.file.last_modified_date("YYYY_MM_DD hh:mm:ss A") %>` , which outputs the date the note was last modified, following a specific format: `YYYY_MM_DD hh:mm:ss A`.
5. It outputs the date today, using `<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>`. It outputs the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
6. It classifies if the `type` of the note I made within my `_dailies` folder is an entry, as in a Dailies entry, or not. By default, it's classified as an `entry`.
7. Through `<% await tp.file.move("/_dailies/" + tp.file.title) %>`, Templater sees if the file I'm currently on is within or outside the `_dailies` folder, specified in `"/_dailies/"`. If it's outside, it automatically puts it within the specified directory. And lastly...
8. `<% tp.date.now("YYYY_MM-DD") %>` outputs the date now, with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, and then appends another string with the `|` character alongside `<tp.date.now("hh:mm:ss A") %>`, which outputs the date now with the format `hh:mm:ss: A`.

I know I might have overly complicated how I explained things, and there may be a few better terms I could use to have simplified the entire list of actions that this Templater template made, but that list shows everything that's being done by each of those... commands? (I don't know what they're called). Or lines of code.

I really want to learn how to code again. Should I re-learn it? I have a little bit of knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JS -- that's it. But I'm gonna be honest, I don't know that much.
