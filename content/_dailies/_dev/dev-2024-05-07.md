Hey there. Just came from [[2024-05-07]] and started to code.

Adding this snippet as a *context*:

I'm getting bored because I feel like FCC's holding my hand all throughout! I need to **contextualize the code on my own!** I feel like my learning's being limited because I **already know what's being taught** and it's frustrating me so much that I can't move forward fast enough because of every little step they make me do. ðŸ˜’

At this point, I think it's even easier if I made my own project, instead of following their tutorials. It's really annoying.

Anyway, that's it. I'm done coding today. Time to get lunch and then get ready to go to my Capstone class! ðŸ¤“
