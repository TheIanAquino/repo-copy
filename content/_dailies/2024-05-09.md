Heya! GOSH. What a day it has been. To say I **enjoyed** and felt **fulfilled** is an understatement. I've been tinkering around the code of my Quartz website and finally got around to a look that I *actually* like! How does it look now? Hehe ðŸ˜‰

OH, and I also finally got around to buy a domain name! And that domain name, as you probably could already tell, is https://ianaquino.xyz/. I love how *modern* it is. I like how simple it is, yet so elegant. Dot `xyz`? Are you kidding me? That's fucking DOPE.

Anyway, well... to be fair. This is my first website. One that I legitimately put effort on. I'd been writing on this thing the past few days, and my excitement for it's only but gone higher. It's extremely cathartic being able to go through the process of trial and error, trying to look-dev my website, down to the slightest of the slightest degree of change in saturation values.

It's also nice that I now recognize [[CSS]] once again! Heck, it's the reason why I even got to tinker with the website's colors in the first place. Not to mention, of course, the wonderfully-written documentation of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). If anyone's curious about the hexcodes of my website's colors, just take a look at the picture below:

I wish I could have a before picture, but all I can show is an *after* picture, lol. Here's a video of me casually browsing through the website:

Anyway, I think that's it for now. I really have to sleep so I could wake up at the proper time for my shift tomorrow. Today's been **a-fuckin'-mazing**, to say the least.

Lastly, here's how I had spent my day today, according to [Toggl](https://track.toggl.com/profile#external-calendars):

That's it! I'll go to bed now and continue doing this thing tomorrow. I'll see you then. ðŸ©¶
