Hey there, lol. I shouldn't be writing this at 12:20:59 AM. However... I can't help but notice I'm number 2 in this list, ðŸ¤£:

Heya. I just updated a few matches to my [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) matches. You can see the updates [here](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master). I added a few interesting stuff, like the ones in this list, for example, which I can't wait to use for work:

>[!TIP]- `;hc.ask` | Asks for the details of an assigned project.
>
>Hey ``{{hatchAsk.name}}`` 
>
>I'm ok to accept this project, given I can get the following details
>
>- When is this project due?
>- Are there upcoming meetings and/or brainstorming sessions that I can join for this project?
>- Are there existing materials that designers can use (brand books/typefaces, existing design files, etc.)?
>- Are there additional information that I could use to further my understanding for this project?

>[!TIP]- `;hc.confirm` | Repeats current information about the project in the context of the current conversation.
>
>Repeating current information from our conversation for validation/correction:
>
>Deadline: 
`{{hatchConfirm.deadline}}`
>
>Existing Materials: 
`{{hatchConfirm.existingMaterials}}`
>
>Additional Information: 
`{{hatchconfirm.additionalInformation}}`
>
>If no mistakes are present, please let me know. 
>
>Thank you so much.

>[!TIP]- `;hc.update` | Sends quick project updates with variables related to the name of the person I'm conversing with, the name of the project, the current time, and the current project pass count. 
>

Hi again. I've been hearing a few information about [Obsidian Quick Add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQVQ37y6IU) but I really haven't gotten around to finally trying it. To be fair, I'd been hearing it a lot during the time that I was losing interest in Obsidian and PKM due to the complexity of the new [properties system](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-properties-best-practices-and-why/63891). I'd spent a lot of my time back then learning [Obsidian dataview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTObSymEvWA&pp=ygURb2JzaWRpYW4gZGF0YXZpZXc%3D) only to realize that what I'd been learning were to become obsolete in the future updates of Obsidian.

Anyways, I encountered a really nice video regarding Quick Add today. Of course, it had to be an NVDH video lol. Not a lot of people could explain complex ideas in Obsidian as quickly and as simply as she could. That's probably why I enjoy watching her content a lot.

I'll be trying it out soon and documenting it here on my [[_index-dailies|dailies]].

# **[[2024-05-06]]** | *02:51:25 PM*

I added another interesting function in my [personal espanso](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master):

>[!INFO]- `;devContext` | Asks for a [[_index-dailies#^bd1c7a|context]] based on my [[_index-dailies#_dev|dev log]], and outputs the following string, so I could use it in Obsidian.
>```
># **[[dev-2024-05-06|dev-2024-05-06-{{context-here}}]]** | *02:52:26 PM*
>```

I probably would stop writing every single update on my Espanso configuration here, so if you're interested to see the latest updates on it, feel free to check my GitHub from time to time to stay updated! ðŸ¤“
