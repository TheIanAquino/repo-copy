Heya. I just updated a few matches to my [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) matches. You can see the updates [here](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master). I added a few interesting stuff, like the ones in this list, for example, which I can't wait to use for work:

>[!TIP]- `;hc.ask` | Asks for the details of an assigned project.
>
>Hey ``{{hatchAsk.name}}`` 
>
>I'm ok to accept this project, given I can get the following details
>
>- When is this project due?
>- Are there upcoming meetings and/or brainstorming sessions that I can join for this project?
>- Are there existing materials that designers can use (brand books/typefaces, existing design files, etc.)?
>- Are there additional information that I could use to further my understanding for this project?

>[!TIP]- `;hc.confirm` | Repeats current information about the project in the context of the current conversation.
>
>Repeating current information from our conversation for validation/correction:
>
>Deadline: 
`{{hatchConfirm.deadline}}`
>
>Existing Materials: 
`{{hatchConfirm.existingMaterials}}`
>
>Additional Information: 
`{{hatchconfirm.additionalInformation}}`
>
>If no mistakes are present, please let me know. 
>
>Thank you so much.

>[!TIP]- `;hc.update` | Sends quick project updates with variables related to the name of the project, the current time, and the current project pass count. 
>
>Hey `{{hatchUpdate.name}}`. Sending quick project updates here:
>
>Project Name: `{{hatchUpdate.fruit}}`
>
>Time: `{{time}}`
>
>Current Pass Count: `{{hatchUpdate.currentPassCount}}`
