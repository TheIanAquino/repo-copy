- Write about your to-do list of choice, TickTick.
- Idea: my first coding project as an aesthetic website of Filipino curse words.
	- When you open the website, you're met by a Filipino curse word, such as `tang ina!`.
	- When you hover the word, there are CSS properties that make it visually appealing.
	- When you click something in the background, the word will change.
