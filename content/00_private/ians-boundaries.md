# Hard Boundaries

>[!INFO] What are hard boundaries?
>**Hard boundaries** *are non-negotiable limits that I won't compromise on under any circumstances.* These are essential to maintaining my well-being and integrity.

**Time**. *I value my [[00_my-values-sheet#^7be3f5|productivity]] and [[00_my-values-sheet#^d3da9c|rest]] periods and do not allow anyone or anything to intrude upon them unless it is extremely urgent and necessary*. I deserve and have the right to spend time for myself because this is my life, not someone else's. Examples of extremely urgent and necessary situations include medical emergencies, urgent family matters, and issues requiring *my* immediate attention.

**Sleep**. Sleep is crucial for my well-being, so I strictly adhere to my sleep practices. *I do not tolerate disruptions to my sleep unless it is for an extremely urgent and necessary situation* as defined under the Time boundary.

**A no is a no**. Kapag sinabing hindi, hindi. When I say no, it is firm and not open to negotiation. *I expect my decisions to be respected without pressure to change my mind or adjust my values.* For instance, if I decline an invitation that conflicts with my values, do not push me to reconsider or offer alternatives. My decision is final unless I specify otherwise.

**Non-abusive communication**. I expect respectful conversations, free from any form of hostility. *Shouting, yelling, insulting, manipulation, or coercion are not tolerated.* If a discussion becomes heated, I will ask to pause the conversation and resume it when we can both speak calmly.

# Soft Boundaries

>[!INFO] What are soft boundaries?
>**Soft boundaries** *are adaptable and flexible, allowing for adjustments based on changing contexts and reasonable considerations.* They can be negotiated or compromised upon when appropriate reasons are provided and both parties agree.

**Quality time**. Although I value quality time with those I care about, my schedule can be unpredictable due to other responsibilities. *Let's communicate in advance about our plans to ensure we make the most of our time together.* If changes are necessary, inform me as soon as possible, and I will do the same.

**Gift-giving**. While I appreciate receiving gifts, I prefer them to be thoughtful and considerate of my interests and needs. *Avoid giving gifts purely out of obligation for events like holidays without first checking with me about what I might want or need.*
