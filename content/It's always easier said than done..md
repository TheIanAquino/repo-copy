It's always easier to talk about the grandiose plans we have for our lives. It's always easier to know, than to practice. I wrote about this idea in [[knowledge isn't practice]] which, to this date, I still haven't finished yet. 

But it's a concept that I've been playing around with since I've encountered the idea of self-development. Here's a clearer example:

> The act of loving is different from knowing the concept of love.

This is precisely why psychopathy exists -- there are people who can understand an emotion, but not empathize with and feel it.

I can understand happiness, know its history and etymology, the rationale behind its conception as a word, perfectly recite, line by line, its first appearance in the paragaph of a book, yet still struggle to feel it.

This I know to be true because I've always carried with me a lot of knowledge on different aspects, yet I struggle to *do*, if that makes sense. Studying the art is different from doing the art.

Here's another example:

> Saying I will be a millionaire in 5 years is **easy**. Doing it is **hard**.
