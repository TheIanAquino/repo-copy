## Highlights
* Eating eggs High blood cholesterol levels are only an issue when you are also consuming lots of carbohydrates.
* Cholesterol is vital for so many of the body’s functions. Cholesterol is essential for bile synthesis, sex hormone production, and vitamin D production. Your brain is 50% fat and 50% cholesterol, and the synapses between the neurons in your brain are lined with cholesterol. Eggs are good for brain health.
* One of the best things about consuming eggs is that your body can use 48% of the protein content. If you only consume egg whites, that number drops to 17%. You need the fat from the egg yolks to fully utilize the protein from an egg.
* Increasing your egg intake promotes normal cholesterol levels and provides a better protein source than many other foods. In fact, eating steak and eggs can boost testosterone!
* Egg protein has the greatest anabolic effect—48% of egg protein is converted into body protein.
* Your body is only able to convert 32% of the protein in meat and fish.
* pasture-raised eggs are better than commercial eggs. Their protein content, cholesterol content, and overall nutritional value are based on how the chickens were raised and what they were fed.
* The insulin index is a scale that classifies how different non-carbohydrate foods affect insulin. Whole eggs have a much lower effect on insulin than egg whites alone. When you remove the fat from a protein source, you have a greater insulin spike.
* Seventy-five percent of the cholesterol in your body is made by your body. The other 25% is dietary cholesterol and comes from the foods that you eat.
* There are two types of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is considered “good” cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is considered bad.
* LDL is a combination of cholesterol, triglycerides, protein, and other fats—and it’s only dangerous when it oxidizes. Cholesterol can become oxidized by sugar or high levels of insulin. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for oxidized cholesterol.
* Eating eggs and other foods high in cholesterol isn’t necessarily the problem. For instance, avocados and eggs are amazing for your hair and nails. You don’t need to cut out saturated and unsaturated fats to maintain normal cholesterol levels—you need to control insulin spikes.
* If you do intermittent fasting and keto, you can improve insulin resistance over time. Furthermore eating eggs protects your liver if you are postmenopausal.
* The studies that connected too many eggs to an increased risk of heart disease were largely flawed.
* A study that was partially funded by the American Heart Association examined 30,000 people using only a questionnaire to determine their eating habits. For this to be accurate, the participants would need to be truthful and also recall every snack and meal they've eaten by memory alone. The data was collected in one single visit and did not examine any other risk factors for heart disease that a person might have. The study claimed that 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol each day was enough to increase your risk of heart disease by 17%. The body makes 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol per day, so this claim doesn’t make much sense.
* Several studies have debunked claims that consuming too many eggs causes heart disease. Check out this study showing that the dietary cholesterol from eating eggs isn’t dangerous at all.
* Eggs are an excellent source of bioavailable vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, including: * Fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, D, K1, and K2) * Choline * Lecithin * B vitamins * Healthy fats (DHA, EPA, and omega-3s) * Carotenoids for eye health * Bioavailable amino acids * 7 grams of protein
* Eggs are loaded with B vitamins which give you natural, sustainable energy throughout the day. They’re also an excellent source of omega-3s, especially if the hens are pasture-raised and consume lots of insects.
* Eating eggs has little effect on insulin when you consume the whole egg. Eggs have an almost perfect nutritional profile—high in protein and fat and low in carbs. They help you maintain healthy cholesterol levels and are amazing for the keto diet.
* If you’re satiated,
* The saturated fats in eggs also allow you to burn fat rather than glucose, which supports weight loss and fat-burning.
* Eggs contain the compound sphingomyelin, which prevents plaquing in your arteries. They also have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.
* Eating eggs provides you with a bioavailable source of vitamins A, E, D, and K, as well as B vitamins. Eggs contain almost every essential nutrient that your body needs.
* Most healthy adults can consume 4 eggs per day with no problems at all. How many eggs you consume depends on your size and daily caloric needs, but 4 eggs a day is not too many.
* Four eggs for breakfast or lunch provide you with a healthy source of fat and protein.
* Eggs are high in many essential nutrients like fat-soluble vitamins, B vitamins, choline, and lecithin. They have a high protein content and are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids.
* Eggs can raise your HDL cholesterol, but that is good cholesterol and is necessary for hormone production, brain function, and bile synthesis.
* Eggs are an excellent source of dietary fat and protein—and they’re low in carbs!
* No, you should consume egg whites and egg yolks together. Eating only egg whites has a much greater effect on insulin.
* No, eggs do not increase the risk of heart disease. Studies that claim this are flawed and are typically observational studies that can be easily manipulated.
* One egg contains 180 to 210 milligrams of cholesterol.
* LDL cholesterol is only bad when it becomes oxidized. Sugar and insulin can cause cholesterol oxidation.
* One egg contains 70 to 80 calories, depending on the size.
* Eggs contain all of the fat-soluble vitamins and contain minerals like selenium, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium. They also contain small amounts of iron.
* Poached or over-easy eggs are the best eggs for keto because they retain the most nutrients.
