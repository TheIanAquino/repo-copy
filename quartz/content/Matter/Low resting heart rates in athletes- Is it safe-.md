## Highlights
* A low resting heart rate, also called bradycardia, can be a symptom of certain health conditions. However, in athletes, it is typically not worrying.
* People who exercise a lot, particularly endurance athletes, tend to have lower resting heart rates (RHRs) than others. This happens because aerobic exercise strengthens the heart, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently.
* According to the American Heart Association, a typical RHR ranges from 60–100 beats per minute (bpm).
* Athletes typically have lower RHRs. While there is no “ideal” RHR, a 2018 research review showed an association between lower RHRs and better health.
* Aerobic exercise strengthens the heart muscle, allowing it to pump more blood with each beat. This results in a lower RHR. As a person exercises more and becomes fitter, their RHR will likely decrease.
* The typical RHR for adults is usually between 60–100 bpm. However, it is important to note that these figures depict heart rate measurements taken in clinics, so they may not represent heart rates in general.
* Generally, lower RHR links with better health. A 2017 research review showed that a RHR increase of 10 bpm raises the risk of all causes of death by 17%.
* Athletic heart syndrome is a relatively noncancerous condition affecting people who exercise regularly.
* Exercise can cause a variety of changes in the heart, often called sport-specific cardiac remodeling, including increases in: * heart muscle size * heart capacity * blood output
* While athletic heart syndrome is relatively rare, there is usually no need to diagnose it because it typically causes no symptoms. However, if an athlete experiences cardiac symptoms, a doctor can rule out other heart conditions like: * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: In this condition, the heart muscle becomes unusually thick. * Left ventricular noncompaction: This rare condition, usually present from birth, happens when the left chamber of the heart does not develop properly and cannot pump enough blood. * Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia: This happens when muscle in the right chamber of the heart dies, causing arrhythmia, or irregular heart rhythm.
