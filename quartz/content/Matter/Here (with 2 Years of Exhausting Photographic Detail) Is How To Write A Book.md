## Highlights
* Before I was a writer, I was simply a reader. Like many readers, I was somewhat in awe of the process. I had no idea how the books I read were made, or how if I was beginning to then aspire to one day write one myself, how on earth I would manage to string so many words together.
* The author and poet Austin Kleon has done the creative world an enormous favor with his concept of showing your work.
