# Hi there!

Glad to see you here -- this page is what I would generally recommend people to start, when they start fiddling with my website.

This page going to be some sort of a **User's Guide to the Author**. Sure, you might see my quirks from my #articles and my [[./_dailies/_index-dailies|dailies entries]] here and there, but the cream of the crop's gonna be in this page, if you want to know who I *actually* am.

Think of this page as an introductory page, or perhaps the usual **about** page of websites, except with one catch: It's not about the website per se, as in the Public Journal. Enough information about that can be found in, again, the [[./index|landing page]].

Instead, this page is about the author himself, which is me.

# Okay, so who am I?
