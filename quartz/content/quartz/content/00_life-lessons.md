I've been toying around the idea of building a public repository of life lessons for people. And by people I don't mean individuals within a particular age group. Just... people in general, without any discriminatory/particular/specific criteria. 

So here is that idea, finally, in its nascent form: a list of life lessons that people could go back to when they get, say... challenged by life.
