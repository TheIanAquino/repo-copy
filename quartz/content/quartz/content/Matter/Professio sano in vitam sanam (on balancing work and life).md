## Highlights
* “When I was at work, I worked. And when I was with my family, I concentrated on them. The change in focus cleared and refreshed my mind so that when I went to work, I was efficient…Five to eight hours per day of clear thinking and concentrated work five days per week produces more impressive results than the coffee, chit-chat, and various displacement activities that often fill the time of many of those who think they are working seventy or eighty hours a week.”
  * **Note**: A quote from Stephen Stearns, the Edward P. Bass Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University.
* *professio sano in vitam sanam:*a healthy profession in a healthy life.
