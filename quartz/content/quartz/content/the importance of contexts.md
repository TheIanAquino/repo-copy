>[!INFO]- A *context* within the [[the importance of contexts|context]] note. How cool!
>In the fear of repeating myself, I would like to quickly provide *[[the importance of contexts|context]]* that most of what you would see in the initial part of note is already outlined in the [[./index|landing page]].


You would find me using this word a lot in my public journal. In this page I outline what it is and why you should bother.

Here's a primer of what it is, based on the existing snippets in my public journal which, again, you might already find in the [[./index#^b2406c|landing page]].

# Case Study No. 1 

My public journal is context-dependent. A good way to understand what I'm trying to convey with this description is through reading this [[the importance of contexts|context]] I put in the [[./index|landing page]]:

![[./_dailies/2024-05-04#^59f004|2024-05-04 > ^59f004]]

All of that is to say that I don't bother much with the specifics of the writing process. At this point, I am *not* obsessed with quality, as is often preached by a lot of people on the internet. As you probably could already tell, I am not the type of person to care enough about the perfection of something I make. I care much more about the volume at which I formulate my materials, and this is for a lot of reasons. [^1]

My philosophy is this, as you probably have already read in the callout above:

> I am 100% confident that you would find a lot of grammatical, semantic, typographical, and perhaps even spelling errors on this website.
> 
> However,Â **the one type of mistake you won't find is contextual errors.**

# Case Study No. 2

![[./_dailies/_index-dailies#^41d7d5|_index-dailies > ^41d7d5]]

To expound on this idea, it is important that I state the *why* of such case, and why I claim that you "*probably* wouldn't understand half of what I would be writing about." To tell you frankly, you *could* understand what I'll be writing about. However, it is the case that I have no way to guarantee the seamlessness of the method through which I transfer my experience to you through writing. 

[[./_dailies/2024-05-04#^94443b|Here's a quick way to explain it]]:

![[./_dailies/2024-05-04#^94443b|Here's a quick way to explain it]]

All of that is to say my *contexts* vary greatly from yours as you read my material. I experience the world differently, and your *context* might be extremely different, resulting in a completely distinguishable way of contextualizing the content of my public journal.

# Footnotes

[^1]: In an article[[./Readwise/Ali Abdaal, Quantity Over Quality|Ali Abdaal, Quantity Over Quality]] by [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/about/), he talks about the importance of *quantity* vs *quality* in creative endeavors. I apply the same principle in my public journal, though it is not with the intention to grow an audience or formulate a business like Ali's students in his Part-Time YouTuber Academy, which is the [[the importance of contexts|context]] of the article. In addition, I don't think anything of what I'm doing in my Public Journal is creative, though I understand how that could be the [[the importance of contexts|context]] of other people when they see what I'm doing. I consider it more as an outlet, or a fun project, or a *brain sketch*, if you will, rather than something through which I deliberately channel my creative energy. More often than not, it feels more like a brian exercise than it is an artistic endeavor, which I like a lot.
