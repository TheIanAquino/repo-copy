Hey there, lol. I shouldn't be writing this at 12:20:59 AM. However... I can't help but notice I'm number 2 in this list, ðŸ¤£:

>[!TIP] I can't make this shit up -- doing this thing is actually IMMENSELY fun, lol.

Heya. I just updated a few matches to my [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) matches. You can see the updates [here](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master). I added a few interesting stuff, like the ones in this list, for example, which I can't wait to use for work:

>[!TIP]- `;hc.ask` | Asks for the details of an assigned project.
>
>Hey ``{{hatchAsk.name}}`` 
>
>I'm ok to accept this project, given I can get the following details
>
>- When is this project due?
>- Are there upcoming meetings and/or brainstorming sessions that I can join for this project?
>- Are there existing materials that designers can use (brand books/typefaces, existing design files, etc.)?
>- Are there additional information that I could use to further my understanding for this project?

>[!TIP]- `;hc.confirm` | Repeats current information about the project in the context of the current conversation.
>
>Repeating current information from our conversation for validation/correction:
>
>Deadline: 
`{{hatchConfirm.deadline}}`
>
>Existing Materials: 
`{{hatchConfirm.existingMaterials}}`
>
>Additional Information: 
`{{hatchconfirm.additionalInformation}}`
>
>If no mistakes are present, please let me know. 
>
>Thank you so much.

>[!TIP]- `;hc.update` | Sends quick project updates with variables related to the name of the person I'm conversing with, the name of the project, the current time, and the current project pass count. 
>
>Hey `{{hatchUpdate.name}}`. Sending quick project updates here:
>
>Project Name: `{{hatchUpdate.fruit}}`
>
>Time: `{{time}}`
>
>Current Pass Count: `{{hatchUpdate.currentPassCount}}`

Hi again. I've been hearing a few information about [Obsidian Quick Add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQVQ37y6IU) but I really haven't gotten around to finally trying it. To be fair, I'd been hearing it a lot during the time that I was losing interest in Obsidian and PKM due to the complexity of the new [properties system](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-properties-best-practices-and-why/63891). I'd spent a lot of my time back then learning [Obsidian dataview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTObSymEvWA&pp=ygURb2JzaWRpYW4gZGF0YXZpZXc%3D) only to realize that what I'd been learning were to become obsolete in the future updates of Obsidian. ^75d965

Anyways, I encountered a really nice video regarding Quick Add today. Of course, it had to be an NVDH video lol. Not a lot of people could explain complex ideas in Obsidian as quickly and as simply as she could. That's probably why I enjoy watching her content a lot.

I'll be trying it out soon and documenting it here on my [[./_index-dailies|dailies]].

I added another interesting function in my [personal espanso](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master):

>[!INFO]- `;devContext` | Asks for a [[./_index-dailies#^bd1c7a|context]] based on my [[./_index-dailies#_dev|dev log]], and outputs the following string, so I could use it in Obsidian:
>```
># **[[dev-2024-05-06|dev-2024-05-06-{{context-here}}]]** | *02:52:26 PM*
>```

I *probably* would stop writing every single update on my Espanso configuration here, so if you're interested to see the latest updates on it, feel free to check my [GitHub]() from time to time to stay updated! ðŸ¤“

I added the new Obsidian callouts as a set of matches in my [Espanso](https://github.com/TheIanAquino/my-espanso/tree/master) configuration. Here's an example:

>[!TIP]- `;oTip` | Outputs a string that asks for the title of the callout, and then automatically puts the cursor in the content of the callout:
>```
>>[!TIP] {{title-here}}
>>
>```

Just a while ago I read [[../../../Readwise/Anthony Ongaro, Identifying the Twitch Thatâ€™s Keeping Us Distracted and Stagnant in Life|Identifying the Twitch That's Keeping Us Distracted and Stagnant in Life]]. I learned about what he calls the Twitch:

![[../../../Readwise/Anthony Ongaro, Identifying the Twitch Thatâ€™s Keeping Us Distracted and Stagnant in Life#^4b96a5|Anthony Ongaro, Identifying the Twitch Thatâ€™s Keeping Us Distracted and Stagnant in Life > ^4b96a5]]

Just this night as I finished up a little housekeeping, I hopped on to my computer to check my to-do list. Immediately as I sat, I pressed the hotkey for [Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/): `alt space`. I knew this was wrong, as I went to my computer to look at my to-do list.

And then I got an idea: what if I could keep a log of whenever the Twitch happened, so I could show to everyone just how distracted I am. I know, no one probably cares. Again, I do this public journaling thing for myself:

![[./_index-dailies#^41d7d5|_index-dailies > ^41d7d5]]

So here it is, my [[../Twitch Log|Twitch Log]].

I just finished communicating my boundaries to my partner, and I felt immediate relief. It's nice that I got to finally make boundaries for myself which I would strictly enforce. It's so great to feel this way, especially when you'd been in a a people-pleaseing mode for the majority of your life.

Just recently I'd been trying to be more precise with what I need. And I know it's a process -- that I won't immediately get the hang of it. But it's been a nice journey for me. And by nice, I mean it's been rocky, and challenging, and at times really stressful. Despite these, it's still really fulfilling. Communicating what I need, whether it be in the workplace or in my personal life, makes me feel as if I *actually* existed. As if I had needs and desires of my own -- to which a person would say, "Well isn't that how it's supposed to be, in the first place?" Well, yeah! I think that's supposed to be te *default* for everyone -- for them to be capable of communicating their wants and needs. Unfortunately for me, that hasn't always been the case. And so tonight, I would consider, is a win! ðŸ¤“
