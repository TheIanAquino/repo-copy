I've encountered this idea multiple times before finally coming to the conclusion that writing is, indeed, thinking.

I first encountered it from [Dr. Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/), who said these words:

> ["The best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfDOoADCfkg)

I then got it from [David Perell](https://perell.com/) who said, [[./Readwise/David Perell, Writing online is a superpower|"Re-writing is re-thinking."]]

Here's a quick summary of my highlights from [[./Readwise/David Perell, Writing online is a superpower|"Re-writing is re-thinking."]]:

Re-writing is thinking, no matter through which angle we look at it.
