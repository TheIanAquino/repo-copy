There's quite a bit of importance, I think, in yapping about whatever you want, whenever you want, in one condition:

That you don't declare what you're yapping about as truth, but instead a constant journey of trying to understand things.

Isn't that what all life is for? Is to understand what really *is* going on -- whatever that means? And if mistakes are treated as some sort of aberration in the process of humans to understand a set of such complex stories and interactions and phenomena as the universe, then I think we're doing something wrong.

**We're all bound to make mistakes.** I guess that's what I'm trying to get at. As a matter of fact, I think we *should* make mistakes. No one should run away from it. I don't think that's an effective way to go about in life, especially since we constantly adjust ourselves relative to the information that we currently carry. Now, what do I mean by that?

Picture this:

A toddler who barely knows about any sort of 'wrong', and 20-year-old who has some idea of what could or couldn't be 'right'. In some ways, we could let the toddler grow to be someone who somehow sees wrong in what the 20-year-old believs as 'right'. 

And of course, there's a lot of nuance to this, right? There's a lot of things that could go on below the surface. There's the distinguishable sets of experience that the toddler and the 20-year-old has, paired with the insurmountable amount of difference that they have yet to experience while going through the motions of life. But the point remains: we're all just blank slates, *[[./Matter/John Locke’s Empiricism- Why We Are All Tabula Rasas (Blank Slates)|tabula rasa]]*, as John Locke would say:

![[./Matter/John Locke’s Empiricism- Why We Are All Tabula Rasas (Blank Slates)#^0a93e3|John Locke’s Empiricism- Why We Are All Tabula Rasas (Blank Slates) > ^0a93e3]]

I'm an ultra optimist in this case, but I think it's the case that mistakes happen all the time, and it just kinda sucks that we need to grow and learn from them. But again, that's our only *good* choice.

So go out, and please, please, yap it all out, and learn from the feedback you get from people.
